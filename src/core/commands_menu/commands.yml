## TEST YAML CONFIG FILE

## ALL COMMANDS ARE PUT INTO THE COMMANDS SECTION
## ALL DESCRIPTIONS ARE PUT INTO THE DESCRIPTION SECTION

## THE ORDER OF THE COMMANDS AND DESCRIPTIONS DON'T MATTER, SO LONG AS BOTH
## THEIR NAMES MATCH - e.g THEY MUST BOTH BEGIN WITH 'start: [...]'

commands:
  start: "start"

descriptions: 
  start: "a simple start test"
