#TODO Idea: Put module info on repository and it will be links to the repository for each module
__module_info__ = """ 
The admin module consists of the majority of the admin features that can be used within a Telegram
group. These most notably involve banning, kicking, promoting, muting, purging etc. 

It's important to note that there are other features on this Telegram bot such as an antiflood system
and blacklists. However the reason that they are separated from the main admin features is because 
they are complex enough to contain quite a few commands and require many more database tables to handle. 
In that sense it is better if they are written separately as it makes it easier for people to read through
the source code.

Upon running one of the commands it will run the corresponding callback function asynchronously. Often the
commands in this file are similar to one another ("ban", "dban", "tban") and so they are handled by the same
function which will detect the variation and act accordingly.

Another important aspect of the admin file is that it contains timed bans and timed mutes. Due to the way it
has been coded, you can't display more than one specified time format at a time. For example, if you wanted
to mute someone for '5h 10m' that would not be possible as when the time string is handled and the time 
formatted it is only expecting either 'm', 'h' or 'd'.

Detailed command information:

[ban/dban/tban]

When running a ban. This means that the user will be removed from a chat without the possibility of being able
to join back from invite links or other non-admin users. They can however join back if they are added back into
the chat by an admin. A dban simply deletes the message that is replied to as well as banning the user that wrote
the message. A tban specifies a time limit that the user is banned for (information on format above). I have programmed 
an implementation where the bot will immediately send the user a PM that specifies how long it is tbanned for. This 
message will also contain the chat's current invite link. This way once the time has passed that the user is banned,
they are capable of clicking on the invite link and joining the group again without needing to contact an admin or 
other member to add them back. This works as long as the invite link isn't changed during that period of time.

[unban]

Similarly to tbanning someone as mentioned above. When a user is unbanned then the bot will send the user a message
containing the invite link that allows them to join back into the group. A message must either be replied to in order
to specify the user or their username/mention supplied so that their user id can be extracted from the database. If 
the person has never interacted with the bot before then the bot is forbidden to sending them a private message. In 
this case the bot ignores sending the message, meaning that the user must be added back some other way. When a user is
unbanned under the influence of a tban then it will immediately cancel the tban and enable them to join back into the 
group.

[kick, dkick]

When a user is kicked, they will be banned for a second and then immediately unbanned. Like before, a kicked user will
receive a message from the bot (if they've interacted with the bot before) and will receive an invite link to join back
into the group. The dkick simply deletes the replied message whilst also kicking the user of the original message. From
the perspective of the kicked user, it will appear that they get removed from the group and then immediately reinvited back
into it.

[purge, purge [n]]

Purging involves deleting all the messages from a replied message up until the current messages. This can be especially 
useful if there was a particular incident that lasted a certain amount of messages in the group and you would like to be
able to remove them. As well as this, specifying an integer number after the /purge command can allow it to only delete
that number of messages from the replied message. This could be more desirable over the first command when there is a 
cut-off point that you would like to stop the purging as there may be some messages that you don't want to delete.

[del]

Running delete on a message will delete the replied message. There's nothing more to do...

[promote, fullpromote]

The difference between promoting and full promoting a user is an interesting concept. When a user is promoted they will have
some privileges gained however not all. Specifically, when a user is promoted then they'll be able to post, edit, and delete 
messages, manage chats, video chats and topics as well as invite users. However, they will not be able to change info, restrict
members and promote members. These are argually the three most important permissions as it controls whether they'll be able to 
do the majority of the commands on this module. On the other hand, when a user is fully promoted then they will be given the same
permissions as the bot, and seeing that the bot must be an admin with full permissions to be able to run all of its commands properly
then the user will be given full permissions. It's important to note here that once a user is fully promoted then they will be incapable
of being demoted as they become an admin.

[demote]

When a chat member is demoted, they will have all the exact permissions as when promoting set to False. This is different when considering
it to being muted as they aren't outright incapable of sending anything, however they will find that the control they have over the group and
what they're able to do with it is practically non-existent.

[mute/tmute]

Muting a user renders them completely incapable of sending anything to the group. However, they'll still be present in the group whilst they're unmuted.
A tmute will mute the user for a period of time and then unmute them. Telegram provides a useful notice message at the bottom of their screen which lets
the user know how long they'll be muted for and at what time they can talk again. The only ways for a user to be unmuted are most likely from the time limit
running out or being manually unmuted by an admin. Another way could be from removing them and then being added back into the group (not yet tested). A user
being muted is different from a user being promoted/demoted. This is because when a user is promoted/demoted they are having their Chat Administration Rights
changed as according to the Telegram API. However, when a user is muted then they're having their own Chat Permissions reduced. The former involves the capability 
of managing the latter involves the capability of being able to send messages and media.

[unmute]

Unmuting involves giving the user full capability to send messages and media. This could give the user more privileges than they originally had even if they were 
able to send for example messages but not media. Unmuting also lifts other restrictions off of the user, such as whether they can invite other users or pin messages.
Another useful point to make is that unmuting a user applies to both muted or tmuted users. In the case of the user being tmuted then it will cancel the time that the
user was supposed to be muted for.

[invite]

Running the invite command will either generate a new invite link to send to users or send the current invite link that can also be used to invite users into the group. 
It all depends on whether an invite link is currently generated or not. Invite links are important ways that users can rejoin the group without needing to directly contact
an admin or other member to add them back in. A user would notice if they'd been banned that any spare and still generated invite links will be shown as 'This invite link has 
expired', however once they are unbanned then the invite link will work again and invite them back into the group. This is important in monitoring that users can't be invited
back into a group whilst they are banned unless by an admin user from adding them.
